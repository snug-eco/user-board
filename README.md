# Snug User Board

KiCad schematic and PCB layout for the snug user board.
This board is intended for private single-person use.
Kernel flashing is supported through the AVR ISP IDC socket.
Terminal UART work over USB serial through a USB-B socket,
which also provides power for the board.
During operation, the board switches its SPI bus to the SD-Card slot.
Port C of the ATmega1284 is broken out to a 10-Pin socket
and can thus be appropriated by the user for additional functionality.
